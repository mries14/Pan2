US,"Tight and tannic, with an herbal edge, this stiff and rather unyielding wine remains a bit puzzling. Hints of cranberry, mulberry and blueberry are somewhat overtaken by herbal, earthy notes.",,87,25.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Southern Oregon,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Abacela 2009 Malbec (Southern Oregon),Malbec,Abacela
US,"Enhanced with 5% Roussanne, this bottling offers deep blueberry and blackberry fruit on the nose alongside touches of black licorice, oak smoke, sandalwood and caramel. Hints of juniper and pine needle show on the thick palate, giving a bitter complement to the thick and unctuous blueberry and fudge flavors.",Western Widow Caliza Vineyard,92,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Brian Benson 2013 Western Widow Caliza Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),Syrah,Brian Benson
Spain,"Compost, rubber and stalky berry aromas come through the nose to the mouth. The palate is tight and tannic.

France,"Produced in the Entre-deux-Mers region, this light, fresh wine has young tannins and stalky black-currant flavors. It is crisp with lively acidity and a juicy aftertaste.

US,"Whole clusters of Syrah are co-fermented with Viognier to create this tight, concisely crafted wine. This is a firm expression of field and grape, with bright berry fruit and chocolaty tannins.

US,"Very little of this reserve was produced in 2011. A blend from five vineyards, it spent 10 months in 43% new oak. Firm and a bit steely, it has tight dark fruits anchored in a streak of earth and iron.
